# 🐍 Python Katas Practice

This repository contains a collection of **kata-style exercises** developed in Python.  
The goal of this project is to practice algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills through short, self-contained coding challenges.

## 1. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Strengthen problem-solving abilities in Python through **katas** (short algorithmic exercises).  
- Practice writing clean, efficient, and well-structured code following best practices.  
- Provide a learning resource that can be easily reused or expanded when needed.

## 4. Results and Conclusions

The project provides a set of exercises that progressively improve algorithmic and logical reasoning.

The notebook format makes it easier to combine code + explanations + results in one place.

The exercises can be adapted for coding interviews, study sessions, or personal learning paths.
