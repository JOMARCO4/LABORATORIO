# SQL QUERIES

## 1. Project Objective
This project aims to show that I have been able to learn how to do SQL queries.

## 2. CONTENTS and PROJECT STRUCTURE
1. PNG IMAGE outlining the BBDD structure we are going to work with, which simulates a 'VIDEO SHOP'
2. SQL file to be loaded onto DBeaver. There you will find a SCRIPT with all 64 questions/queries to be executed and completed. You will have the statement and then it comes the query solution.

## 3. Requirements

- A computer with internet connection to be able to visualize a GitHub repository.
- DBeaver to be able to load the SQL file and see the script with the different queries.

## 4. Results and Conclusions
It has been a very interesting project. Some questions have been very easy while others have been somehow challenging and have required more time and going back to lecture notes.
Personally, I am satisfied with the level of speed and confidence I have got after going after all these queries and I think I have enough resources and knowledge to defend myself in future matters related to SQL.
